# ColliU

ColliU is a desktop based social network designed to facilitate communication between university teachers and students. By combining events hosted by the university and by the student union this united platform ensures the user that they will not miss out on events.

We strive to ensure that our platform is easy to use and accessible for people of all ages. We do this by having a slim and bareboned design where everything relevant to the user can be found on a single page. We have also included different types of filters that are easily toggleable to get a more personalized experience using our platform. 

If you are experiencing any troubles with our platform make sure to contact us or any of our administrators. Our information can be found on page INSERT CORRECT PAGE HERE
